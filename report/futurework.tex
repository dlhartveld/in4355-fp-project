A platform such as the one described in this paper is of course never
``finished''. Even though the project that we have done is completed within the
scope of the course Functional Programming, there is lots of room for improvement.
We see several important opportunities for functionality extension or improvement
of existing functionality, that would make the platform even more interesting.

\subsection{Adding a partition step}
The MapReduce approach that we currently use, is missing an important piece: the
partition step. It would be interesting to see whether this step can be supported
in a generic fashion, within the constraints of the platform as it is currently. 

\subsection{Uploading new jobs}
Jobs are currently hard-coded in the system. It is not possible to dynamically
add additional jobs while running the server. This is of course an important
feature that is missing.

\subsection{Write job code in language other than js}
Jobs can be defined in javascript. But this probably isn't the most ideal
approach to this problem. It might be interesting to explore the possibilities
of using other languages for this purpose. It might even be interesting to see
whether the use of a simple DSL would fit this situation. Would the DSL be
compiled to some intermediate form on the server? Or would the clients interpret
it themselves? There is probably a lot of interesting stuff possible here.
